# 🏎️ F1 Race Engineer AI: From Beginner to Deep Learning

Welcome to the **F1 Race Engineer AI** project! 

This repository documents a 4-day journey into Natural Language Processing (NLP), designed specifically for beginners. We build up from basic grammar analysis to a Deep Learning model that classifies Formula 1 radio messages, culminating in a fully functional **Streamlit Dashboard**.

- **`app.py`**: The final interactive dashboard.
- **`project_days/`**: The code evolution, day by day.
    - `day1_syntax.py`: Understanding sentence structure.
    - `day2_ner_lm.py.py`: Identifying F1 terms and predicting words.
    - `day3_embeddings.py`: Teaching computers "meaning" using math.
    - `day4_deep_learning.py`: Building an AI Brain (Neural Network).
- **`project_visualization/`**: Visual outputs (HTML trees, graphs) generated by our scripts.

## 🚀 The Journey

### Day 1: Syntax Analysis (The Structure)
**Goal:** Understand *how* a sentence is built.
We used **spaCy** to break down sentences into a "Dependency Tree".
- **Concept**: Every sentence has a ROOT (Action) and a Subject (Actor).
- **F1 Example**: *"Hamilton is complaining"* -> Actor: **Hamilton**, Action: **Complaining**.

### Day 2: Named Entity Recognition & N-Grams (The Terms)
**Goal:** Teach the computer F1 Vocabulary.
Standard models know "Person" or "Country", but we needed it to know **Drivers**, **Tires** (Softs, Hards), and **Actions** (Box, Pit).
- **Technique**: We built a Custom `EntityRuler`.
- **Bonus**: We built a simple **Bigram Model** (Probability) to predict that after "Box", the mostly likely word is "Box" or "for".

### Day 3: Word Embeddings (The Meaning)
**Goal:** Understand that "Tires" and "Rubber" mean the same thing.
Computers usually treat words as just strings of text.
- **Technique**: **Word Vectors**. We convert words into lists of 300 numbers (coordinates). Words with similar meanings have widely similar coordinates.
- **Result**: `similarity("Tires", "Rubber")` = **80% match**.

### Day 4: Deep Learning (The Brain)
**Goal:** Classify urgency without explicit rules.
We moved beyond simple rules to a **Neural Network** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- **Input**: A sentence converted to numbers.
- **Model**: A "Sandwich" of layers (Embedding -> Average -> Dense).
- **Output**: A probability score (0 to 1).
- **Result**: The AI learned that words like "Fire", "Fail", "Stop" imply **URGENCY** (1), while "Strategy", "Tires", "Push" imply **NORMAL** (0).

### Final: The Dashboard (`app.py`)
We combined everything into a web app using **Streamlit**.
- You can type your own messages.
- Watch the AI analyze syntax, find entities, check similarity, and classify urgency in real-time.

    ```

## 📚 For Beginners
This project proves that AI isn't magic; it's just math and structure. 
- **spaCy** helps us with the structure (Linguistics).
- **TensorFlow** helps us with the patterns (Statistics).
- **Streamlit** helps us show it off (Web Dev).
